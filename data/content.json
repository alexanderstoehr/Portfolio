By 2013, I was building / optimizing WordPress sites and freelancing as an SEO consultant, helping businesses get noticed online. \nFast forward to 2014, and I dove headfirst into the ecommerce space, where I specialized in everything from marketing to product development.\n\nIn 2018, I became a Google Ads professional (a Google Partner with a closet full of Google branded Hoodies and Shirts they sent me), which basically means I can geek out over data and ad optimizations all day long. But despite all that time spent optimizing everything from search rankings to conversion rates, one thing always nagged at me: I still didn’t really know how to code.\n\nSo, after years of procrastination and dabbling, I finally decided to go full-stack (with the help of an awesome but very challenging six month bootcamp) in 2023, focusing on React and Django. Now, I get to build both the front and back ends of web applications and feel like I’ve come \"full\" circle in my web journey. Still a 10^6 things to learn, but it is different now.\n\nI’ve spent over 15 years soaking up everything web-related—and let’s be honest, probably spent too much time doing so—but I wouldn’t have it any other way.\n\nIf I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring trails on my MTB, practicing Muay Thai, or diving into the world of DSA — the German, more detailed take on DnD."
